## Sales page

In the past year, Contoso‚Äôs total revenue stood at $14.42bn, a sharp 42% drop compared to last year‚Äôs $25.08bn which can be an negative signal for Contoso's performance.

Looking closer at the regional split, a fascinating contrast appears:

- North America,LATAM and EMEA struggled, falling by more than 40%, showing the uneven impact of market conditions across the globe.

And then there are the products. The star of the show is the E-reader line, bringing in a staggering $5bn, dwarfing everything else. Accessories like covers and pens added billions more, proving that the ecosystem around a hero product can be just as profitable.

Behind the scenes, people drive these wins. Names like Molly Clark and Alicia Thomber stand out, each generating more than $4bn in sales. Their performance shows the importance of top talent that the right employee can shift millions, even billions, in revenue.

One particularly interesting insight is that small discounts, as little as 3.3% , can significantly increase the chances of winning opportunities. This shows that customers don‚Äôt always demand deep cuts often, just the perception of added value is enough to close the deal.

## Customer feedback page

Sales numbers tell only half the story. The other half comes directly from customers.

Across the year, Contoso customers delivered mostly positive feedback:

- 5.3K reported being ‚ÄúVery Satisfied‚Äù

- 3.5K said ‚ÄúSatisfied‚Äù

- Fewer than 2K expressed dissatisfaction or disappointment.

This paints a picture of a company that‚Äôs largely meeting expectations, though not without its weak spots.

Digging deeper, the entire E-reader family stands out for the wrong reasons, with ratings consistently falling below the overall average. While discount strategies around these products help drive strong sales, the lower satisfaction scores reveal a weakness: customer trust can erode quickly if product quality, especially in accessories, doesn‚Äôt meet expectations.

Customer service interactions also reveal a surprising truth. Speed isn‚Äôt everything. Cases resolved in 61‚Äì80 minutes earned the highest ratings (4.61), while ultra-fast responses sometimes scored lower. Customers value thorough, thoughtful service over rushed answers. And when service teams miss SLA targets, ratings plummet from 4.52 to 3.45, proof that reliability matters as much as speed.

Among service agents, Sanjay Shah and Eric Gruber shine, consistently earning top ratings above 4.3. Just as in sales, the performance of a few outstanding individuals lifts the company‚Äôs entire reputation.

# ‚úÖ Key Takeaways

- Financial Performance: The past year has been a difficult one, with overall revenue declining sharply. While North America, LATAM and EMEA struggled significantly.

- Customer Success: Satisfaction remains high overall, but the entire E-reader family, particularly accessories, received ratings below average, signaling areas for improvement.

- Operations: Tier 1 support is critical, handling nearly half of all service cases and forming the backbone of customer assistance.

- Sales Strategy: Success is driven by targeted discounts, strong product quality, and active engagement with key decision-makers.

- Service Strategy: SLA compliance and a balanced response approach, not just speed are essential to maintaining customer trust and high satisfaction.
